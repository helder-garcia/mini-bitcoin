Minimal Bitcoin Implementation (Satoshi White Paper, not Bitcoin Core)

Just small 7 files.

https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

Mini-bitcoin is a simple bitcoin protocol implementation (except Merkle tree and script language)

The goal of this project is to allow any Java programmer to create their own currency.

There are about 10 million of Java programmers around the world.

Our goal is to decentralize the power of creating currencies. 

Currencies must compete in the market, like any goods or services. 

Bitcoin was invented for this, not to be a single global currency. 

Just as a single world government would be a disaster for freedom, so is money. 

Bitcoin is centralized in a few big miners and few developers. 

Bitcoin support is done by fake libertarians, blinded by easy money.

Nick, Roger and Craig are just a few more traitors of libertarian movement. 

Join us. Fork this. Create your own cryptocurrency. Freedom!

# How to GO
1) Install Java Runtime Environment (You probably already have)

2) Download Eclipse IDE - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

3) Clone or fork this repository.

4) Eclipse File->New->Java Project (copy files inside when ready)

# Understanding the code
Inside mbtc.Main you get the "main method" starting point.

Put a breakpoint in the fist line -> U.logVerbosityLevel = 2;

Go debugging. :-)

No threadssss, just ONE execution line.

You have your wallet, miner, server and client working (p2p) and command terminal.

RPC not ready yet.

# Dont be shine. Fork this. Create your coin!
Money must compete in the market, like any good or service.

This is the right thing to do.

If you need my help, don't hesitate to ask me.

Thanks! Enjoy!
