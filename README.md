Mini-bitcoin is a simple bitcoin protocol implementation (except Merkle tree and script language)

The goal of this project is to allow any Java programmer to create their own currency.

There are about 10 million of Java programmers around the world.

Our goal is to decentralize the power of creating currencies. 

Currencies must compete in the market, like any goods or services. 

Bitcoin was invented for this, not to be a single global currency. 

Just as a single world government would be a disaster for freedom, so is money. 

Bitcoin is centralized in a few big miners and few developers. 

Bitcoin support is made up of fake libertarians, blinded by easy money. 

Nick, Roger and Craig are just a few more traitors. 

Join us. Fork this. Create your own cryptocurrency. Freedom!
